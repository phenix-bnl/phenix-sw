Project 5 is the simulation of pairs for HBT.  The files are described below.

Creating OSCAR input
--------------------
eventMaker -- executable to create oscar output for pisa

Makefile   -- makes eventMaker from eventMaker.C
              configured to work on LLNL gps cluster only

pionwest.input   -- for multiple pions in west arm
protonwest.input -- for multiple protons in west arm
  the format is [pdgid] [npart] [phimin] [phimax]

eventMaker.sh -- checks environment and calls eventMaker.pl 
eventMaker.pl -- loops over output files and calls eventMaker

Interactive Usage: eventMaker.sh [name] 
      Batch Usage: psub -tM 50:00 -o eventMaker.log -r eventtMaker eventMaker.sh [name]

e.g. [name] = "pionwest"


Submiting pisa jobs
-------------------
submitpisa.pl  --  Creates directories, copies files, and submits pisa jobs.
                   Jobs will be run in the area defined by $P5NFS, one job per directory.
                   Common usage is "submitpisa.pl --subset=pionwest".
                   Type "submitpisa.pl --help" for other options.


submitpisa_multi.pl -- Same as above, but runs mutiple pisa runs per batch job.


Misc. scripts
-------------
cleanpisa.pl -- used to check statistics and move files to single directory
                in preparation for copying to rcf
rcopy.pl     -- sets up simultaneous scp streams to copy whole directoreis to rftpexp.

Pisa files
----------
event.par and pisa.kumac are taken from this directory.  Other pisa inputs, 
such as magnetic field map are copied from the cvs/simulation/pisa2000/wrk area.

	Class FROG - File Replica On Grid

Method FROG::location translates a logical file name (given as an
argument) to a physical location(full file path).

If environment variable GSEARCHPATH is not set FROG::location 
returns  a logical file name(LFN) back.

Environment variable GSEARCHPATH is a colon separated list that 
can contain local directories  and reserved words for  database 
search. The word for Objectivity search is OBJY.

Example: if the GSEARCHPATH=.:/home/$USER/:OBJY
first the current directory will be searched for LFN, then the
/home/$USER/ directory, then Objectivity.
If the file exists in more than one place, the first found path 
will be returned.

The user code need not be changed in different environments - with
DB access and without. If GSEARCHPATH indicates that DBs should be
searched, a dynamic library will be loaded at run time for each DB 
to do the search. 
 
If LFN starts with a slash, it is considered an absolute path and
FROG::location returns it if the file exists, otherwise an empty string
is returned. 

Example of ROOT session:

root [0] gSystem->Load("libFROG.so");
root [1] FROG fr;
root [2] TFile *f = new TFile(fr.location("uuDST_run2_v03_burn1-0000033694-0050.root"));

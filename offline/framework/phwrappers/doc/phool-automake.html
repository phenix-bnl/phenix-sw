<h1>Editing Makefile.am</h1>

<!-- hhmts start -->

<!-- hhmts end -->

<p> This discussion is intended to provide guidance on editing the
Makefile.am files that genAutoMake produces.  It is not intended to be
a guide to creating a Makefile.am from scratch, nor is it a general
introduction to automake.  For detailed information, see the
documentation at the
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~tromey/automake/">automake home page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Generalities</h2>

<p> The Makefile.am files use the following standard automake
variables to define lists of source files to be created or compiled
during the build:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> include_HEADERS
  <dd> list of header files that will be installed.
  <dt> noinst_HEADERS
  <dd> list of header files that will <em>not</em> be installed.
  <dt> libabc_la_SOURCES
  <dd> list of files that need to be compiled to make the shared
      library libabc.so.
</dl>

<p>Previous versions of this document made references to the
BUILT_SOURCES list, which contained the source files to be created by
an external program such as phidl or rootcint.  The makefiles seem to
work fine without this list as of automake version 1.4a (and perhaps
earlier), and the use of BUILT_SOURCES in Makefile.am in general seems
to be becoming obsolescent (see, for example,
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/automake/2000-01/msg00076.html">
this message to the automake mailing list</a>).</p>

<h2>Specific Cases</h2>

<p> Building new source files into the shared libraries for your
analysis package is generally a matter of adding appropriate file
names to these lists.  Let's look at a few common cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#adding_table">Adding a new wrapped table</a>
  <li><a href="#adding_staf_module">Adding a new STAF-style (wrapped) module</a>
  <li><a href="#adding_phool_module">Adding a new PHOOL-style module</a>
  <li><a href="#adding_class_nocint">Adding a new class (without a CINT dictionary)</a>
  <li><a href="#adding_class_cint">Adding a new class (with a CINT dictionary)</a>
</ul>

<h4><a name="adding_table">Adding a new wrapped table</a></h4>

<p> To compile a new wrapped table, the Makefiles need to know about
your table IDL file, and the files that the phidl IDL compiler and the
rootcint dictionary generator create from the IDL file.</p>

<p> As an example, say that you have a table IDL file, dAbcData.idl .
Running phidl produces:</p>

<dl>
  <dt> dAbcData.h
  <dd> a header file for the struct containing the data variables
  <dt> dAbcDataWrapper.h dAbcDataWrapper.C
  <dd> a header and implementation file for the wrapper class
  <dt> dAbcDataLinkDef.h
  <dd> a "linkdef" header file for rootcint
</dl>

<p> To generate the CINT (ROOT) dictionary, the Makefile will run
rootcint with the wrapper header file and the "linkdef" file as
inputs.  Running rootcint produces dAbcDataDict.h and dAbcDataDict.C,
the source files for the dictionary. </p>

<p> You'll need to add these files to inc/Makefile.am:</p>

<ul>
  <li> add the IDL file to include_HEADERS
  <li> add the "linkdef" file and the dictionary header file to
      noinst_HEADERS
  <li> add the struct header file and the wrapper header file to
      include_HEADERS
  <li> add the wrapper "C" file and the dictionary "C" file to
      lib???_tables_la_SOURCES (replace ??? with
      the name of your analysis package, "abc" in this example)
</ul>

<p> In the simplest case, where there is only one wrapped table
(dAbcData.idl), and there are no other headers in the source inc/
area, the source lists in our example inc/Makefile.am will look
something like this:
</p>

<pre class=source>
noinst_HEADERS = dAbcDataLinkDef.h dAbcDataDict.h

include_HEADERS = dAbcData.idl dAbcData.h dAbcDataWrapper.h

libabc_tables_la_SOURCES = dAbcDataWrapper.C dAbcDataDict.C
</pre>

<h4><a name="adding_staf_module">Adding a new STAF-style (wrapped) module</a></h4>

<p> To compile a new wrapped module, the Makefiles need to know about
your module IDL file, and the files that the phidl IDL compiler and the
rootcint dictionary generator create from the IDL file.</p>

<p> As an example, say that you have a module IDL file,
mAbcFillData.idl and a STAF-compatible module source file,
mAbcFillData.cc .  Running phidl on mAbcFillData.idl produces the
following files:</p>

<dl>
  <dt> mAbcFillData.h
  <dd> a module header file containing the function prototype for
      mAbcFillData.cc
  <dt> mAbcFillDataModule.h mAbcFillDataModule.C mAbcFillDataPAM.C
  <dd> a header and implementation files for the wrapper class
  <dt> mAbcFillDataLinkDef.h
  <dd> a "linkdef" header file for rootcint
</dl>

<p> To generate the CINT (ROOT) dictionary, the Makefile will run
rootcint with the wrapper header file and the "linkdef" file as
inputs.  Running rootcint produces dAbcFillDataDict.h and
dAbcFillDataDict.C, the source files for the dictionary. </p>

<p> You'll need to add these files to src/Makefile.am:</p>

<ul>
  <li> add the module header file, the wrapper header file, the
      "linkdef" file, and the dictionary header file to noinst_HEADERS
  <li> add your module source file to lib???_la_SOURCES (replace ???
      with the name of your analysis package, "abc" in this example)
  <li> add the wrapper "C" files and the dictionary "C" file to
      lib???_la_SOURCES (replace ??? with the
      name of your analysis package, "abc" in this example)
</ul>

<p> In the simplest case, where there is only one wrapped module
(mAbcFillData.idl), and there are no other source files in the source
src/ area, the source lists in our example src/Makefile.am will look
something like this:
</p>

<pre class=source>
noinst_HEADERS = mAbcFillData.h mAbcFillDataModule.h \
mAbcFillDataLinkDef.h mAbcFillDataDict.h

libabc_la_SOURCES = mAbcFillData.cc mAbcFillDataModule.C \
mAbcFillDataPAM.C mAbcFillDataDict.C
</pre>

<h4><a name="adding_phool_module">Adding a new PHOOL-style module</a></h4>

<p> To compile a new PHOOL-style module, the Makefiles need to know about
your module source files and the files that the rootcint dictionary
generator creates.</p>

<p> To write a PHOOL-style module (let's use mAbcPrintData as an
example), you will need to write a header file
(mAbcPrintDataModule.h), an implementation file
(mAbcPrintDataModule.cc), and a "linkdef" file
(mAbcPrintDataLinkDef.h).  (The documentation for writing these files
does not exist yet.)  You will also need a CINT (ROOT)
dictionary, which is generated by running rootcint with the module
header file and the "linkdef" file as inputs.  Running rootcint
produces dAbcPrintDataDict.h and dAbcPrintDataDict.C, the source files
for the dictionary. </p>

<p> You'll need to add these files to src/Makefile.am:</p>

<ul>
  <li> add the module header file, the wrapper header file, the
      "linkdef" file, and the dictionary header file to noinst_HEADERS
  <li> add your module source file, the wrapper "C" files, and the
      dictionary "C" file to lib???_la_SOURCES
      (replace ??? with the name of your analysis package, "abc" in
      this example)
</ul>

<p> In the simplest case, where there is only one PHOOL-style module
(mAbcPrintDataModule.C), and there are no other source files in the source
src/ area, the source lists in our example src/Makefile.am will look
something like this:
</p>

<pre class=source>
noinst_HEADERS = mAbcPrintDataModule.h \
mAbcPrintDataLinkDef.h mAbcPrintDataDict.h

libabc_la_SOURCES = mAbcPrintDataModule.C mAbcPrintDataDict.C
</pre>


<h4><a name="adding_class_nocint">Adding a new class (without a CINT dictionary)</a></h4>

<p> To compile a new class without a CINT dictionary, the Makefiles
need to know about your class source files.</p>

<p> To write a class (let's use TAbcClass as an example), you will
need to write a header file (TAbcClass.hh) and an implementation file
(TAbcClass.cc).  It is a good idea to place both files in the src/
subdirectory, so that the most up-to-date version of the header file
can be found easily.</p>

<p> You'll need to add these files to src/Makefile.am:</p>

<ul>
  <li> add the class header file to include_HEADERS
  <li> add the class source file to lib???_la_SOURCES
      (replace ??? with the name of your analysis package, "abc" in
      this example)
</ul>

<p> In the simplest case, where there is only one class
(TAbcClass), and there are no other source files in the source
src/ area, the source lists in our example src/Makefile.am will look
something like this:
</p>

<pre class=source>
include_HEADERS = TAbcClass.hh

libabc_la_SOURCES =  TAbcClass.cc
</pre>


<h4><a name="adding_class_cint">Adding a new class (with a CINT dictionary)</a></h4>

<p> To compile a new class and create a CINT dictionary, the Makefiles
need to know about your module source files and the files that the
rootcint dictionary generator creates.</p>

<p> To write a class (let's use TAbcClass as an
example), you will need to write a header file
(TAbcClass.hh) and an implementation file
(TAbcClass.cc), and a "linkdef" file
(TAbcClassLinkDef.h).  It is a good idea to place all three files in
the src/ subdirectory, so that the most up-to-date version of the
header file can be found easily.</p>

<p> You will also need a CINT (ROOT) dictionary, which is generated by
running rootcint with the class header file and the "linkdef" file as
inputs.  Running rootcint produces TAbcClassDataDict.h and
TAbcClassDict.C, the source files for the dictionary. </p>

<p> You'll need to add these files to src/Makefile.am:</p>

<ul>
  <li> add the "linkdef" file to noinst_HEADERS
  <li> add the dictionary header file to noinst_HEADERS
  <li> add the dictionary "C" file to
      lib???_la_SOURCES (replace ??? with the name of your analysis
      package, "abc" in this example)
  <li> add the class header file to include_HEADERS
  <li> add the class source file to lib???_la_SOURCES
      (replace ??? with the name of your analysis package, "abc" in
      this example)
</ul>

<p> In the simplest case, where there is only one class
(TAbcClass), and there are no other source files in the source
src/ area, the source lists in our example src/Makefile.am will look
something like this:
</p>

<pre class=source>
noinst_HEADERS = TAbcClassLinkDef.h TAbcClassDict.h

include_HEADERS = TAbcClass.hh

libabc_la_SOURCES =  TAbcClass.cc TAbcClassDict.C
</pre>

<h2><a NAME="REV_HISTORY">Revision History</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt>June 28, 2000</dt>
<dd>Removed references to BUILT_SOURCES.  The document still refers to
    the inc/ and src/ subdirectories, which are no longer used, so more
    work needs to be done.</dd>

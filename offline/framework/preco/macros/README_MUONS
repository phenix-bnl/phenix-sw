The following macros tends to be the official set of Fun4All macros to be used
for doing the muon analysis using new framework MUTOO and MUIOO packages, MWG
nano dst package and MWGpico pico dst package. They are:

Fun4Muons_Pisa.C
to generate a new framework simulated dst, containing MC information from a pisa
file.

Fun4Muons_RecoPRDF.C
to reconstruct a PRDF file, possibly adding level2 and offline filtering, 
generate a reconstructed DST, a nanoDST and a picoDST.

Fun4Muons_UnpackPRDF.C
to unpack a PRDF into a unreconstructed DST. Usefull for producing background DSTs 
for embedding studies.

Fun4Muons_RecoDST.C 
to run mutoo reconstruction on a DST, using the muid/mutr hits as a starting 
point; generate a reconstructed DST, a nanoDST and a picoDST.

Fun4Muons_ReadDST.C
to read a reconstructed DST, generate a nanoDST and a picoDST, without running
the mutoo/muioo reconstruction

Fun4Muons_RecoDST_sim.C
to run mutoo reconstruction on a simulated DST (slowsim), using the muid/mutr MC
hits as a starting point; generate a reconstructed DST, a nanoDST and a picoDST.

Fun4Muons_Display.C
to run mutoo 3D and 2D event display on a reconstructed DST.

All macros also have various evaluator enabled by default. You may disable them
by changing the switches inside.

  \section intro Introduction 
  
  MutGeom is the interface to the muon tracker geometry. Hardware modules all have their corresponding objects organized hierarchically from arm down to single strips/wire. The library also serves as an interface to the geometry and calibration database. Some utility macros are provided to use these objects and update/read the database.

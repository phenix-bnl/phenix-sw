Please, notice:	a) Currently, the "clusters" are actually just "pixels" which
		   are NOT combined into contiguous clusters.
		b) The default version of rawhit building does NOT account
                   charge sharing between pixels and strips. In the case the
		   charge sharing needs to be ON, one should comment/uncomment
		   a few clearly marked lines in the body of the protected
	           "makeRaw(...) method in the SvxStripixel.h module.

	Your suggestions and bug reports are very welcome !!!

Directories:
	offline/packages/svx      - Contains Silicon vertex reconstruction code
	offline/packages/svx/wrk  - Contains sample macros for running analysis
        offline/framework/simreco - Contains SvxSimreco analysis module.

How to run:

	1. Go to a PISA work directory. Run PISA with SVX detector "ON" and
	   	create PISAEvent.root & svxPISA.par files.

	2. Go to the analysis work directory (e.g. offline/packages/svx/wrk).
		Link (or copy) PISAEvent.root & svxPISA.par files into this
		directory. Type "root -b -q svxreco.C >& log.log &".
                This macro will process 5 events and fill the diagnostic TTree 
                and a few histograms. TTree is stored in the svxRecoOut.root file,
		and histograms are stored in the svxHistogramOut.root file.

	3. (optional) Start root, connect svxHistogramOut.root file and draw some
		histograms, using "draw_svx_*.C" macros.

	4. (optional) Modify (locally!!!) "analyze_svx.C" (and/or everything else) and
		use it for running your analysis with the input from the svxRecoOut.root file.

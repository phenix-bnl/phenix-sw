One thing I tried was to take
the KKP charged-hadron ff's and "modify" them
as people sometimes do it to turn them into
h- and h+ separately. So for example I take
the (for h-) "favored"  d  ff and multiply it by
(1+z)/2
whereas the "unfavored" u is multiplied by
(1-z)/2.
This is for h- , for h+ you would just do the
oppposite.

After this modification, I seem to get much bigger
numbers at eta=3.2:

a factor 3 or so larger than what I had for Kretzer.
I am not claiming this is the right way of doing it
(in fact I may have made a mistake; I did this
rather quickly!), but if true it indicates that
there is a *lot* of uncertainty concerning the ff's
here. Perhaps Kretzer h- are "anomalously" low,
who knows.

// pi0 production at 200 GeV from Ina Sarcevic:
// *.data files at /home/enterria/wrk/pQCD/revdataRHIC with labeling:
// PionRHIC200(Shadow)(EnergyLoss)(Scale factor)
//  Shadow: PP, EKS
//  EnergyLoss: NoLoss, Loss0.3,0.5,1.0
//  Scale factor: QF1.0  (scales set to p_T) or QF2.0 (scales set to 2p_T)

//  *.data file is in the format (pt, Ed^Bsigma/d^3p, K factor, AA/pp)
// invariant cross section integrated over
// 1 unit of rapidity.  Units are pb/GeV^2 for all files
// except once that are labeled *.data_AA, those are in
// mb/pb^2. 

//  For instance, PionRHIC200EKSLoss0.3QF1.0.data
//  means it's pi0 calculation at 200 GeV with EKS shadowing with
//  eps=0.3GeV and Q = 1.0 pt.

//  We use MRS99 structure functions and BKK (Binnewies, Kniehl and
//  Kramer) fragmentation functions.

//  Files that end with *.data_AA* are original multiplied by number of
//  collisions that you sent us.

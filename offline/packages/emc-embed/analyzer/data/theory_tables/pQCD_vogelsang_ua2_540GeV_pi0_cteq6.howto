For UA2,  the lower pt results are at fixed pt
(I didn't know the exact bins), the higher pt (from 5.75)
are averaged over pt bin as usual. Note that for
Kretzer's ff's z has to be larger than 0.01, which excludes
the UA2 data for pt <2.8 in this case.  I wouldn't put
much trust in the KKP ff's there either!

This code is part of the ilmbase 1.0.2 software package available from 
http://www.openexr.com/
The original Makefile.am is included as Makefile.am.orig to show how
the include files eLut.h and toFloat.h were build. I checked those in - I don't
think it is a good idea to build them every time this package is build

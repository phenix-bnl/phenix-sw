This directory contains, perhaps among other things, the Doxygen config file, Doxyfile_mutoo.  This config file specifies how Doxygen, a code documentation tool, will generate the mutoo code's documentation in HTML.

To use it, obtain the doxygen executable from the Doxygen website:	
    www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
you might also try /phenix/u/jfrantz/doxygen????/bin/
and then run, in this docs directory, 

$ doxygen Doxyfile_mutoo

the documentation will be created in a subdirectory called html (./html)

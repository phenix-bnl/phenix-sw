Tools when just reading DST consuming so much resources.
Method:
   Pick tracks up for 1000 events in a file, write to evaluation
file and exit ROOT once. Then, re-run ROOT and process the next
1000 events using RICH_Alignment::SetEventOffset().
Then, make a TChain of tracks picked-up and run alignment procedure
using RICH_Alignment::SeImportOutput().


Command lines:
rcas20XX> ./mergecompile.sh 

will make a binary executable "merger".

rcas20XX> dstlist.sh <directory name the DST's are put>

will create "dstlist.txt" which describes DST file list and
it's entriess. Then,

rcas20XX> mkdir evals
rcas20XX> ln -s  (built libRICH_Alingment.so path) .
rcas20XX> cp (rich_hotPMTlit.txt path) .
rcas20XX> evals.sh <directory name the DST's are put>

will make evaluation files for each 1000 event of the DST's in 
"evals" directory. Then,

rcas20XX> merger -o tracks.root evals/*

will make a root file which includes TChain pf track Ntuple
of files in "evals" dir.

rcas20XX> root -b -q def_align.C

will generate new alignment file "alignmentf.txt".
Then rename it to "alignment.dat".

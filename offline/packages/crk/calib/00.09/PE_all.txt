# This is correction data for the calibration
# files that T. Sakaguchi generated.
# In this calibration files, there are 20 to 50 PMTs that are
# not properly fit because of "fat" pedestal. I examined those
# problematic channels, and find good fits for most of them, and
# PE and PEW values are obtained. To gain statistic, here I merged
# histogram files of all runs. 
# Those fits are obtained by fit.C in this directory. 
# I also examined the dead channels, and added here. Here I only
# included single dead channels. Those dead channels that appears in
# 8 channel groups are not included.
# This file will be used as an input to edit_rich_adc.cc, and
# PE and PEW values in this files are substitued into the corresponding
# data in the calibration file.

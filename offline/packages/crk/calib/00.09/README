This directory contains files and programs that are used to
store the first round RICH calibration data into Objy.
The major part of calibration work was done by T. Sakaguchi.
He processed about 200 runs and determined the pedestal values
of each PMTs in each run. He also combined several runs to determine
gain calibration, and he got 4 sets. 
I (YA) examined the gain fit results, and refitted some of the
not-so-good fit PMT channels in the original Takao/s work,
and substitued the new fit results in the calibration files.
The revised calibration files are then loaded into Objy database.
THis directory contains all programs I used.

Since those files are here for archive purpose, they should
not be changed.


Explanatons for the files. 

fit.C  --- program used to fit the selected, not-so-well fit PMT
           channels.'
PE_all.txt. -- revised PMT gains obtained from fit.C (with some 
	       manual edit. I can not obtain any good fit for some
	       of the PMTs, In those cases, I set gain =80, for
	       example.

edit_rich_adc.cc --- program used to edit Takao/s original calibration
           files
edit_rich.csh --- driver shell script for edit_rich_adc.cc

merge*.C  --- macro used to merge Root histogram files

CrkCalibInit.C
load_rich_DB.C --- macros used to store the results into Objy.

those are first RICH TAC calibrations done by T. Sakaguchi.
I placed them into the DB on 11/30/00

calib_convt_16ch.txt    TAC GAIN
calib_t0_16ch.txt       T0

According to Sakaguchi-kun, he determined T0 and GAIN in 16 ch group
(because the statistics is too poor for individual PMTs). If the fit
does not work well, TAC gain in forced to -0.125 nsec.

A few summary histograms are in
tac_summary.root
tac_t0.ps
tac_gain.ps

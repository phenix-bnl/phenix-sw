After checking out this package, do the following.
Assume you are at this top directory of Edisp.
% mkdir bld
% cd bld
% ../autogen.sh
 ( this will produces many config* files, missing, Makefile.in, etc
   in Edisp directory and Makefile and others in bld directory)
% make
 ( this will produce libEdisp.so in bld/.libs directory)
% cd ../run
 (Now you are at Edisp/run, where all macros to execute the program
  are placed.)
% ln -s ../bld/.libs/libEdisp.so .
 (Now you have a link to libEdisp.so in Edisp/run directory)
 (Now you are ready to go. Read run/HOW_TO_RUN for further
  information on how to use the program)

this directory contains macros to execute RICH event display.

[STEP 0] Prepare link to input DST file.
The program read a DST file named "centdst.root" and display the event
in it. So, the first step you should do is to make a symbolic link 
"centdst.root" to the  DST file you wish to view

% ln -s your_favorite_DST_file centdst.root

[STEP 1] To start the program under ROOT

To run the program, simply do:

root mydisp_ini.C

This step initialize the program. Now, you are ready to view events.
The above step will produces 6 Canvases. They are
"North" (North side view of PHENIX CENTRAL ARMS)
"South" (South side view of PHENIX CENTRAL ARMS)
"South West" (2D views of RICH, PC3, EMCAL in South West side)
"North West" (2D views of RICH, PC3, EMCAL in North West side)
"South East" (2D views of RICH, PC3, EMCAL in South East side)
"North East" (2D views of RICH, PC3, EMCAL in North East side)

A recommended way to place those 6 Canvases are

NorthEast   North  NorthWesSouthEast   South  SouthWest

In the default size of the Canvases, the above arrangement will
almost complete fill up your dislay screen of 1600x1200 pixel.

At this point, all of those Canvases are blank. You have to load
event. This can be done by (note you are still inside of ROOT)

[STEP 2] Load next good event.

ROOT> .x next.C

This step will load next "good" event. At present, a "good" event
is an event with -20 < Zbbc < 20, where Zbbc is Z-position of
event vertex determined by the BBC.

After this step, you have a fresh now event to look at. To view the
event, you have to

[STEP 3] Display the views.

ROOT> .x disp_evt0.C  // display the "South" View
ROOT> .x disp_evt1.C  // display the "North" View
ROOT> .x disp_side.C  // display the four side views (SW,SE,NW,NE).

You can issue any of those three command in any order.

[STEP *] Continue to next event..

After you are done with this event, you can go to the next event by
repeating [STEP 2] and  and then repeat [STEP 3] to view the event.
You can skip [STEP 3] if you do not want to view the event. Just
repeat [STEP 2] until you come to another interesting event.

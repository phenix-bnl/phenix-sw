NOTE (H. PEREIRA DA COSTA 2005/09/09)
Be carefull when adding new modules.
There are two types of modules:

1/ modules which read/fill/modify mutoo maps (PHMaps or TMutXXXMap)  

2/ other modules, which only use existing mutoo maps without modifying them and
make, say, ntuples.

The type 1 must derive from MuonSubsysreco and not directly from subsysreco. In
their process_event method, they must have explicit call to clear_maps_if_needed() at the
beginning of the method and write_maps_if_needed() at the end of the method. This ensures
that maps are correctly written to output DSTs and correctly cleared at each
new event. The code will not crash if these are missing. However you may have
strange results in the output, depending on in which order your subsystems are
registered in the parent macro.

For other modules (which only does map _reading_), they derive explicitely from
Subsysreco and do not call either clear_maps_if_needed(), write_maps_if_needed() or PHMapManager.

  \section intro Introduction
  MUTOO_Subsysreco is a collection of Fun4All modules to run the various part of the <A HREF="../../mutoo/html">MUTOO</A>/<A HREF="../../muioo/html">MUIOO</A> muon reconstruction/analysis software in a modular way. Each module is designed to perform a well defined task and must in general be used in conjonction with other modules. This modularity ensures that the same piece of software, such as the response chain or the reconstruction chain, is used whatever the input data format is, namely:

<ul>
<li> prdf files (Phenix raw data files)
<li> reconstruted root DSTs
<li> simulated DSTs
</ul>  

  \section fun4all modules

  <a href="group__supermodules.html">Here</a> is the documentation for the main fun4all modules designed for running the muon new software. Still missing are documentations for the various evaluation modules.

  \section intro Introduction 
  
  MuiGeom is the interface to the muon identifier geometry. Hardware modules all have their corresponding objects organized hierarchically from arm down to single tube. The library also serves as an interface to the geometry and calibration database. Some utility macros are provided to use these objects and update/read the database.

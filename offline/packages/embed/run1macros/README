This is a very rough description of Embedding package. Since the rapid change of the root version recently,
user need to recompile this package using the same version of root as you run it. When you run the macro,
you also need to make sure that you have correct offline packages compiled with the same root.
I haven't touch this package for about one month, so I can't gurantee it will work with the latest offline
softwares.



Embedding procedure was described in one talk: /phenix/WWW/p/draft/jjia/hardpwg/correction
one can also find explanations from Ana50 and upcoming analysis note on recent charged spectra analysis

PHEmbedInitializer :
set up the node tree structure nessasory for embedding. it also provide MakeCopy function which copys all
PHTable from one tree to the other.
PHEmbedMixer:
merge single particle DST tables with real event DST tables, merge hits if nessasory, currently merging
of DC hit table  and PC raw table have been done.
PHEmbededEvent:
contains table pointers  relevent to the embeded single track DST, real event DST, so one can fetch the
table pointer directly without the need to seach through the node tree, it also provides functions to
facilate the Evaluation.
PHEmbedMCEvaluator:
this is my private evaluator that I have used for the embedding study.
PHEmbedMcRecoTrack:
this is the place of the evaluation result for one embeded track. it will be dumped to a ntuple and served
as input for efficiency study.
PHEmbedHistogrammer:
if you are familar with PHDchHistogrammer, you will know what this is. Yes, it is a place where all the
evaluation histogram and ntuple were stored(can be written to disk at the end of the root session)

auxilary classes 
PHEmbedRealEvaluator:
is a class designed for evaluating real tracks embed into real events
PHTableNodeReset:
same as PHNodeReset except this class only reset PHIODataNodes.



classes only related to DCH, not directly related to the track embedding procedure
DchTrackSelector
DstGlobalAnalyzer


MACROS:
run like this:
root [0] .x  embedfieldiniMc.C
root [1] .x  embedRunMc.C


one need to modify the macro to reflect your own input MC DST and Real DSTs. If you are familar with
CamTask* macros, you should be able to understand these macroes after some strugglings


This package was put in the analysis area just because it have been used in the QM analysis, full support
should not  be expected until next run data is avaliable and there is a major interest in this direction.

The current output of the embedding chain is a ROOT file containing the
Tree EmbedMcRecoTrack. Each entry in EmbedMcRecoTrack contains the
evaluation information for a single MC particle track embedded into a real
event. Evaluation information is available for the single particle event
before the embedding into a real event. From this, in principle, the single
particle acceptance and efficiency corrections can be determined / cross 
checked. Some information about the real event event into which we embed
the single particle event is kept, e.g. variables characterizing centrality
and vertex position. Finally, information describing the fate of the embedded
particle after embedding into the real event and rerunning the reconstruction
is kept. From that, we get the multiplicity dependent efficiency loss.

In general, Tree entries ending with

"G":  contain information about the original GEANT particle that has been
      identified as the "source", i.e. dominant contributor of DC hits, of 
      the single particle track that is embedded into the real event.
"Mc": contain information directly from GEANT except for the "id" variables
      (see below)
"S":  contain evaluation information for the simulated single particle before
      embedding
"R":  contain evaluation information after embedding and rerunning the
      reconstruction on the merged event

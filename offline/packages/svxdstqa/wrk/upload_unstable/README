remember to 
setenv ODBCINI /opt/phenix/etc/odbc.ini.master
before uploading.  Or replace "master" with "test" to upload to the test database

to write the reference map, modify the string pixelfilename in testWriteReference.C 
and just run the macro



to write the diff maps, one can modify and run the shell script "upload_diff.sh"
one only needs modify the for loop to run over the desired set of text files containing the 
unstable map information.  Note one can also uncomment the "echo" statement and comment
the actual running of root, so that one can be sure that sane run numbers are being passed
to the macro testWriteDiff.C


the instructions for the chip map are the same as for the diff maps, but instead the
shell script is called "upload_chip.sh"


I usually run these with e.g.

nohup ./upload_diff.sh >&upload_diff.out </dev/null &

on an interactive node.  So far they don't take so long that the job will be killed,
but be careful for run14 : probably it is best to upload in small-ish rungroups

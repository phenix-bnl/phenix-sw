README for libodbc++						(1999-09-30)

For installation instructions, check doc/INSTALL.txt or if
you have a browser around, doc/INSTALL.html.

For programming examples, check the tests/ directory.

There's an almost complete class reference residing in
doc/progref/. If you don't find it enough, you can always
check the JDBC2.0 documentation.

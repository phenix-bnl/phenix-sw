The macro Hist2PS.C will produce a postscript file with multiple histograms per
page.  This can be useful with the DST QA histograms.  See comments in the macro
for more details.

run_qa.C is an example of how to use libqadst.so.  See comments in the macro
for more details.

To produce the QA summary text file, run the macro dstQaSummary.C, giving it the
name of a QA histogram file as an argument:

root[] .x dstQaSummary.C("qaout.root")

or, from the command line:

root -b -q dstQaSummary.C\(\"qaout.root\"\)

This is the first working version of Q-PYTHIA into PHENIX. 

OVERVIEW
---------
Right now you can vary qhat and perform fixed path length 
calculations. Those in the future something more 
sophisticated can be developed.

INPUT
--------
In the macro directory there is QPythia.C which shows 
how to run this. The constructor takes in 

1) the random number seed

   If it is set to 0, the current time is used to generate 
   a seed.

2) the configuration file

The configuration files currently knows about the following 
pythia parameters

roots
proj
targ
frame
msel
ckin

Additional there are two other Q-PYTHIA specific parameters

qhat
pathlength

The units of qhat are GeV^2/fm and fm for pathlength. The 
path length represents the fixed path length of all partons 
through the medium. No off-center collisions are produced 
at this time.

OUTPUT
----------
The resulting output is the same as PHPythia:

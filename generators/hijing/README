HIJING 1_383bs.2

internal "bug-fixed" special version in GENSER
Routines and common blocks beginning from "py" are renamed: "py" is substituted
by "pyhi". This way hijing hopefully can be used together with pythia.

NMXHEP for HEPEVT is 10000, PHEP and VHEP in double precision. HEPEVT is
compatible for example with pythia 6_326.2

		      *****************************************
  1)General information
		HIJING basically is designed to simulate multiple jets 
	and particle production in pp, pA or AA collisions. PYTHIA
	subroutines and Lund jet fragmentation scheme are used. Therefore,
	this program uses the same particle identification code as JETSET.72.
	Users can also use subroutines in JETSET.72 and change the values
	of parameters in JETSET.72 and PYTHIA therein. But there are some
	special parameters in HIJING which users have to specify or change.
	This is the  first version. Things may change in the future.
	If you find any bugs or problems please report them to the authors.
	This file contains a example program and all the HIJING subroutines.
	To save compiling time, JETSET.7.2 is not included in HIJING. To 
	meet some specific needs of HIJING, JETSET.72 has been modified and
	renamed as HIPYSET. One should link HIJING with HIPYSET and the main
	program:
     ************************************************************************
     *	$link yourmain,hijing,hipyset					     *
     ************************************************************************

  2)Main subroutines
		There are two subroutines in HIJING which users have to call:

	SUBROUTINE  HIJSET(EFRM,FRAME,PROJ,TARG,IAP,IZP,IAT,IZT)
		Purpose: This subroutine is to initialize HIJING which should 
			be called first before any subroutine. 
		EFRM(GeV): is the colliding energy in the frame specified by 
			FRAME.
		FRAME:	(must be 'LAB' or 'CMS') to specify the frame of the 
			collision
		PROJ,TARG:Character variables of proj and targ particles.
			='P' proton
			='PBAR' anti-proton
			='N' neutron
			='NBAR' anti-neutron
			='PI+' positive pion
			='PI-' negative pion
			='K+' positive kaon
			='K-' negative kaon
			='A' nucleus
		IAP,IAT: mass number of the projectile and target nuclei, set
			to 1 for hadrons
		IZP,IZT: charge number of the projectile and target nuclei,for
			hadrons it is the charge of that hadron(=1,0,-1)

	SUBROUTINE  HIJING(FRAME,BMIN,BMAX)
		Purpose: This is the main program of HIJING which can be 
			called(many times) only after HIJSET is called once. 
		FRAME:	(must be 'LAB' or 'CMS') to specify the frame of the 
			collision
		BMIN,BMAX: are the low and up limits bewteen which the impact
			parameters are randomly but evenly selected for pA and
			AA collisions. For pp collisions, the events are
			averaged over all impact parameters.
 


  5)Main Common blocks
		There are mainly three common blocks which provide users with
		important information of the generated events.

			parameters of the symmetric LUND fragmentatin fuction.
		HIPR1(5):(D=2.0) cut-off for the QCD radiation, string system

			jets), which could be used to study jet in AA 
			collision. If HIPR1(10) is negtive, its absolute value
			gives the low limit of the PT of the sample jets.  
		HIPR1(11):(D=2.0 GeV) Minimum pt of a jet which will interact 
			with excited nuclear matter, or when the pt of a jet 
			is smaller than HIPR1(11) it will stop interacting 
			further more.

			traversing jet and an excited nucleon(or string system)
 			below which they will interact and the jet will lose 
			energy and momentum to the nucleon.

			characterizes the geometrical size of a nucleon
			(HIPR1(31)=pi*b0**2). The default value is only
			for high-energy limite(sqrt{s}>200 GeV). At lower
			energies, a slight decrease which depends on energy
			is parametrized in the program. The default value
			of the above two parameters HIPR1(30),HIPR1(31) are
			only for NN type interactions. For other kinds

			for baryons, and  1/(x**2+HIPR1(45)**2/s)**HIPR1(46)/
			((1-x)**2+HIPR1(45)**2/s)**HIPR(46) for mesons, in
			soft interactions.

		If one want to trig on jets with specified high P_T, the
	following should be included in the program

		IHPR2(3)=1(2,for direct photon production)
		HIPR1(10)=P_T(-P_T for jets above P_T)

	Because large P_T jet has very small cross sections, this will 
	improve the simulation efficiency. The absolute cross section
	can be obtained by multiplying the results with the total
	cross section of such jet production in pp which is stored in
	HINT1(59).
